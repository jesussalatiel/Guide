# Software Development Engineer in Test

A “Software Engineer in Test” (a.k.a. “Software Development Engineer in Test”) is a software developer who develops software for testing: tools, frameworks, and automated tests. SETs focus primarily on automation for running tests quickly and repeatedly. Test automation is a software product: just as front-end developers write web pages and back-end developers write microservices, SETs write automated tests. The same practices and coding skills apply. I frequently say that a Software Engineer in Test must have the heart of a developer.
